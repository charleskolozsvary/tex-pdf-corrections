Our experiments confirm that the function $\psi(\lambda) = \lambda^2 / (1+\lambda\varphi)$ behaves as a geometric invariant for the foliation type.  
However, Eq.~(7) reveals an unexpected resonance near $\lambda = \varphi^2 \approx 2.618$.  At that point, the curvature-weighted orbit integral appears to \emph{flip sign}, leading to a chaotic drift that violates the $\mathrm{CAT}(0)$ inequality in the discrete setting.
